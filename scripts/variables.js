/* STEP 1: Declare variables
	Use a-z, 0-9, A-Z and underscores, avoiding reserved names
	All program variables are generally declared at the beginning (called 'hoisting') */

    /* STEP 2: Initialize variables
	Don't confuse a variable with no value with one that doesn't exist at all */

    /* STEP 3: Updating variables
	Once a variable has been declared, this can be done any time */

    // STEP 4: Variable types
    // Numbers

    // Strings (use '' or "")

    // Booleans

    // Arrays

    // Objects

    // STEP 5: Typing (JavaScript is a loosely-typed language)
